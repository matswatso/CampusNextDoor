Original Milestone 2 Goals:
 - Geofencing campus buildings so the app can know what building you are in based on
your location. This lays the groundwork for the building summary pop ups stretch goal

Milestone Accomplishments:
    "Building Geofencing"
     - Map updated with locations of buildings along the GPX path as well as major buildings on campus.
     We use the user's location to find what the closest building is to the user. 

    "Building Summary Button"
    - Added Building Summary button that displays a new page that goes over the building information 
    of the closest building to the user. This information will be procured through reviews that have been 
    made using our add review system. Some information being displayed is the average of the 
    building location ratings, average amenity ratings, Number of reviews, as well as recent pictures 
    if the exist. 



Changes to timeline:
In our initial plan for Milestone 3 we wanted to use geofencing to determine how to show different 
building information through reviews based on only if the user was actually in the building. However,
we realized this was inefficient since location services can be inaccurate and the exact latlong coversions
may be inaccurate while close to the edge of the building. 

We are still on track for the final product to make the building summary popup with pictures, reviews, 
and comments
