Original Milestone 3 Goals:
 - Geofencing campus buildings so the app can know what building you are in based on
your location. This lays the groundwork for the building summary pop ups stretch goal

Milestone Accomplishments:
    "Building Geofencing"
     - Map updated with locations of buildings along the GPX path as well as major buildings on campus.
     We use the user's location to find what the closest building is to the user. We have a ray casting
     algorithm implemented to find what user the building is in, but we decided closest building is more
     useful and easier to test for the final submission.

    "Building Summary Button"
    - Added Building Summary button that displays a new page that goes over the building information 
    of the closest building to the user. This information will be procured through reviews that have been 
    made using our add review system. Some information being displayed is the average of the 
    building location ratings, average amenity ratings, Number of reviews, as well as recent pictures 
    if they exist. 



Changes to timeline:
In our initial plan for Milestone 3 we wanted to use geofencing to determine how to show different 
building information through reviews based on only if the user was actually in the building. This
does work, but we decided closest building is better for testing purposes and for general user experience

We have essentially finished the final submission stretch goals now. The final submission will be refined.
The card layout we tried for the summary page is a lot nicer looking than the extremely ugly layout we use
for every other page, so we will be adapting it for use everywhere.
