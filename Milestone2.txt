Original Milestone 2 Goals:
 - User GPS tracking
 - Amenity suggestions
 - Attaching Images 
 - Full Review adding functionality

Milestone Accomplishments:
    "User GPS tracking"
     - Map Can follow the user's GPS location along GPX written path through 
     the use of the GPX predetermined paths. 

    "Amenity suggestions"
    - Suggestions button along with tab are created where different reviews can be
    stored based on the users location and proximity to a review.
    - Will suggest 1 area for each type of amenity within 200 meters (if there is one)


    "Attaching Images"
    - Attaching images throug the review add form is completed along with storing these
    images based on the review that they were added with. 



    "Full Review Adding Functionality"
    - The form now dynamically updates for the type of review they are adding and stores
    it accordingly



Changes to timeline:
In our initial plan for Milestone 3 we wanted to use geofencing to determine how to show different 
building information through reviews to the user based on where they are. However,
we have realized that there are some difficulties doing this through flutter google maps
so we will now be linking reviews together by common building name for the building summary.

Within this tab we will have all of the reviews for a specific building that the user will request
and we will generalize the star ratings for each kind of amenity. Essentially, a quick
summary of a building
