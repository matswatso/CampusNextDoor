Original Milestone 2 Goals:

 - Amenity suggestions
 - Attaching Images 
 - Full Review adding functionality

Milestone Accomplishments:
    "User GPS tracking"
     - Map Can follow the user's GPS location along GPX written path through 
     the use of the GPX predetermined paths. 

    "Amenity suggestions"
    - Suggestions button along with tab are created where different reviews can be
    stored based on the users location and proximity to a review.
    - Some different features can be added like filtering based on types of reviews
    in order to allow for users to pick what they need / want near them


    "Attaching Images"
    - Attaching images throug the review add form is completed along with storing these
    images based on the review that they were added with. 



    "Full Review Adding Functionality"
    - We have it so that when a user creates a new review of a specific amenity type, 
    it is added to the 



Changes to timeline:
In our initial plan for Milestone 3 we wanted to use geofencing to determine how to show different 
building information through reviews to the user based on where they are. However,
we have realized that there are some difficulties doing this through flutter google maps
so weve decided to go a different route with this by adding a building information tab. 

Within this tab we will have all of the reviews for a specific building that the user will request
and we will generalize the star rating as well as sort by most recent reviews per amneity that the user
can filter so they can find out what they want to about each building they are researching.
