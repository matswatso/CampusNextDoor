Original Milestone 1 Goals:
    - Map tab completed with a scrollable map
    - My reviews tab
    - Review system with amenity types


Milestone Accomplishments:
"Map tab completed with a scrollable map"
    - Map tab has a functioning map through google maps and the
      google_maps_flutter package
    - Map is scrollable
    - Map has markers for different reviews
    - Tapping a marker pulls up the expanded info view for that review

"My reviews tab"
    - my reviews tab exists
    - has a list of reviews. each review shows:
        - the name of the item reviewed
        - the stars
        - the title of the review
        - the date it was placed
        - an image if one is provided with the review. Currently, no reviews
          have images, so they are all the placeholder icon.
    - Tapping a review opens an expanded info view, the same one that tapping a
      marker shows
    - The expanded info view shows:
        - The name of the item reviewed
        - The name of the reviewer
        - The title of the review
        - The stars
        - The text of the review
        - The special fields
        - In the future, between the text of the review and the special fields,
          the attached image will be displayed. Right now, we haven't
          made the code for attaching images, so this doesn't exist.

"Review system with amenity types"
    - Backend of Review class and Location mixin with respective subclasses for
      type of review (like BuildingReview or BathroomReview) are effectively
      finished
    - Most review types have specialized fields in their subclass, so they have
      a function to generate a Widget which displays these. This is used in the
      expanded info view.
    - We've also half finished functionality for adding new reviews. Currently,
      this dialog does not collect all necessary data. It needs to change based
      on what type of review is being made. We did not have time to do this yet.



Changes to timeline:

We wanted to have image attachments and adding reviews completed by this
milestone, but we did not yet finish that. We are 90% of the way there, but we
didn't have time to finish this bit because we underestimated the amount of work
involved in our milestone 1 goals.

Milestone 2 will still have user GPS tracking and amenity suggestions as before,
but it will also have attaching images and full review adding functionality with
the exception of BuildingReviews. BuildingReview requires geofencing to figure
out what building we are in, so it will be part of Milestone 3.

Milestone 3 is mostly the same as before, except we will also need to create
functionality for adding BuildingReviews.

The final submission's main goal is still to add the building information popup
with pictures, reviews, and comments, but we will also try to aesthetically
improve the app. Currently it looks awful because we are focused on
functionality.
